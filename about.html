        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>I am Menna, a 19-year-old Palestinian from Gaza. As a computer engineering student,
            I was expected to complete my second year by now. I have intermediate experience in web programming
            and several programming languages,
            including Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and C++. I joined the Girls Geeks Camp,
            where I expanded my knowledge in various programming languages, business management, and UX/UI
            design.
            This camp ignited my passion for programming and web development.
            My curiosity about computers and programming led me to pursue a deep journey into technology.
            I believe it is our duty to contribute to making our future better,
            as it is not only ours but belongs to everyone. I chose to study computer engineering,
            but unfortunately, the ongoing genocide in my home our life has been paused to an unknown time .
            My university was bombed, and we have lost much. We have lost much, but I still have many dreams to
            achieve. </p>
